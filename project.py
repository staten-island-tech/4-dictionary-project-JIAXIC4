# You will be creating a little store in your terminal. You will have a list of
# dictionaries that will be displayed to the user. Each Dictionary will have at
# least 3 properties (name, price and whatever you want)
# PART ONE:
# The user will select one item to purchase. You will then show the user
# ONLY the name of the item they purchased. You will need to use the item
# index to accomplish this task.

# PART TWO:
# You will now make the app more complex by incorporating while loops and
# a “cart”. Users will be shown the list of items and asked to purchase one.
# Afterwards ask the user if they wish to continue. Once the user has decided
# they are done shopping, print the names of the items purchased and the
# total of the cart.
